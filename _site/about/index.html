  <h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my personal webpage. I am <strong>Sanchit Alekh</strong>.</p>

<p>I am currently working as a Big Data Engineer at <a href="https://www.reply.com/data-reply/en/">Data Reply GmbH</a> in Munich, where I work on a diverse range of projects, mainly in the area of cloud and distributed computing. On my most recent project, I worked as a part of a team that developed an enterprise chatbot platform on the Microsoft Azure Cloud using technologies such as Kubernetes, Terraform, Botframework and Microsoft Cognitive Services.</p>

<p>Combining my knowledge of software engineering, databases and distributed systems, I help customers develop and deploy complex software that routinely interacts with, and acts upon massive amounts of data on different kinds of infrastructure, i.e., on-premise or on public clouds such as AWS, Azure or GCP.</p>

<p>Previously, I was working as a Data Scientist Intern at <a href="https://www.audi.com/de.html">AUDI AG</a> in Neckarsulm, Germany, where our focus was on building solutions for smart-factories and enable data-driven production. I am a firm champion of using data analytics for making production more efficient, cost-effective and less wasteful.</p>

<p>I pursued my MSc. in Software Systems Engineering from <a href="http://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/?lidx=1">RWTH Aachen University</a>, Germany’s largest and leading technical university, where my coursework and research were focused in the area of ‘Data and Information Management’. I was closely associated with the chair of Databases and Information Systems, where I worked under Prof. Christoph Quix.</p>

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
