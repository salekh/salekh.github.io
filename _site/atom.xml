   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I have spent way too much time not writing anything for my webpage. I hope I’ll be able to change it this year. The past year has truly upended the lives of one and all. My thoughts are with each and every soul on this planet, who have lost one of their loved ones to this virus, for whom the light at the end of the tunnel is the faintest of all. May God provide you strength.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understanding the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/05/27/understanding-the-gdpr/"/>
   <updated>2018-05-27T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2018/05/27/understanding-the-gdpr</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The GDPR, or the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Datenschutz Grundverordnung (DSGVO)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in German, might well be one of the most groundbreaking pieces of legislations of the EU which directly or indirectly affects not just EU citizens, but internet-users all across the globe. However, to make it a real success, one of the most important factors is that we must be better informed and aware of the provisions of this directive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GDPR is the first genuine effort to unify the plethora of disparate privacy regulations put forward by different regulatory bodies. It aims to not only give more control over their personal data to the citizens, but also make conformance for businesses easier by defining unified guidelines. It also presses businesses, especially those dealing with sensitive personal data, to build their information systems in a way that confirms with Privacy by Design. These regulations aim to ensure a more transparent handling and processing of personal data, and create an environment of trust and awareness on both sides, i.e., the data owner as well as the controllers/processors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GDPR mandates that the highest privacy settings be used by default, and ‘explicit and verifiable’ consent be taken from the subject, and at the same time, also bestows the Right to Access and the Right to Erasure, which enables more transparency and accountability while handling personal data. The penalties for non-conformance are major enough that all kinds of companies, from small start-ups to large corporations, must take efforts and steps to follow these regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide a brief introduction to the topic, I wrote a small paper, which can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://salekh.github.io/documents/gdpr.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully, this helps in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the provisions of this law, without using a lot of legal jargon. Indeed, the technology that enables the GDPR is nothing new, and has existed for decades, including our encryption methods. However, the rise of internet users, and the importance of data in the current times has necessiated this urgent push.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen how citizens and businesses react to the GDPR. Many businesses have vol- untarily extended the coverage of the GDPR to non-European citizens as well, which is certainly a bright spot. The effort itself, after years of deliberations in the EU Parliament, on a subject that is important, and yet so personal, is commendable. To make it successful, we will have to work together and ensure a higher awareness amongst internet-users regarding the GDPR itself, and to use their consent in a judicious and privacy-aware manner. Privacy awareness will surely lead to a safer internet, with lesser instances of spillage of personal information. Our politicians have taken the first step towards providing us some guarantees and control over how our personal information is used. Now, the ball is in our court.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Smart Urban Mobility - The Key to our Future</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/05/10/future-urban-mobility/"/>
   <updated>2018-05-10T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2018/05/10/future-urban-mobility</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Up until the last few years, the ways in which humans commuted remained largely the same. Indeed, trains had existed since the early 1800s, and cars and airplanes had already become the ‘next big thing’ in the 1950s. However, change ushered in when we started realizing that the astonishingly powerful engines that power our traditional means of transport are also unfathomably threatening to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, development of technologies such as electric vehicles, the hyperloop concept, the ever- increasing network of efficient public transport and autonomous vehicles, have taken precedence. In my humble opinion, the future ways of urban commuting have to not only be sustainable and efficient, but at the same time, keep the human element alive. As artificial intelligence starts becoming more and more omnipresent, we will have to think of innovative ways to plan our urban landscape in a manner which supports our future means of transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my current involvement at AUDI AG as an intern, I have pondered deeply about how changes in the way we travel will affect our lives. I have often thought that as we switch over to new innovative means of urban transport, we must also strive to keep making our existing systems more efficient and streamlined. E.g., I am a firm believer that more and more cities around the world should build efficient, people-friendly underground/suburban railway systems. At the same time, I believe that we must be well-prepared for the paradigm shifts which are going to happen sooner or later. E.g. the hyperloop technology, which will effectively change the way we currently think of cities and urban spaces themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gadgets such as the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Segway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; promised a sea-change personal urban mobility, but fell short of their hype. But on the other hand, amazing new concepts such as the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;blockchain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are revolutionizing the technological landscape. Blockchain is immediately identified as the raison d’être of cryptocurrency, but in reality, it has exciting applications beyond that. One of its most promising applications would be in regulating our future smart cities and making governments more transparent and accountable. But traffic management and autonomous transport is also set to benefit massively from this groundbreaking technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the future of urban mobility is bright. Our urban spaces will be defined by how conveniently and efficiently they enable people to commute. Whether the idea of our future mobility is airborne personal transport, remains to be seen. But the gradual introduction of autonomous and electric vehicles will definitely be a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Power of Imagination</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/04/27/imagination/"/>
   <updated>2018-04-27T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2018/04/27/imagination</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What is human existence, if not our power to imagine a better world, and the tenacity to make it happen? Since time immemorial, we have imagined superior ways to express, create and invent. This is what has given us infinite possibilities to progress and transform ourselves from hunter-gatherers to a species living a sophisticated life with a purpose.
In the recent years, scientists and researchers have continually strived to push the boundaries of technology further and further. I would go as far as to say that Computer Science, which is a relatively young field of science, would not have risen to prominence if we had not collectively imagined building machines which could undertake and perform the most complex tasks that humans could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, more and more perplexing questions surround us. For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/computers-are-becoming-fa/&quot;&gt;How fast are our computers going to be in future?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601441/moores-law-is-dead-now-what/&quot;&gt;What will happen once we are no longer able to create smaller circuits?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/shephyken/2017/12/17/will-ai-take-over-the-world/&quot;&gt;Is AI going to take over?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raconteur.net/technology/five-ways-quantum-computing-will-change-cybersecurity-forever&quot;&gt;Will all our cryptographic algorithms be broken by quantum computers?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/industry-4-0/smart-factory-connected-manufacturing.html&quot;&gt;Can factories operate without human intervention?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vrs.org.uk/virtual-reality-healthcare/surgery.html&quot;&gt;Can we perform surgeries using Virtual Reality?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these questions have viable answers in imagination. But it doesn’t end here. Imagination also helps us pose the right questions, which I believe, is even more important for a scientist. Imagination has the power to drive the world forward, and that if pursued in a multi-disciplinary and collaborative manner along with a productive exchange of ideas, it can really lead to something substantial and path breaking.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Should Biotechnology take a step back and ponder about Ethical Issues?</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/04/25/biotechnology-ethics/"/>
   <updated>2018-04-25T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2018/04/25/biotechnology-ethics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The potential for synthetic biology and biotechnology is vast; we all have an opportunity to create the future together.” -Ryan Bethencourt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biotechnology has made huge strides over the last few decades. This is reflected in the steadily rising global life expectancy and lower infant mortality rates. However, as technology becomes more advanced and industries grow more powerful, several ethical questions confront us, and the onus to answer them doesn’t fall solely on the shoulders of biotechnology researchers. Indeed, since these topics concern each and every human being, the decisions and deliberations must be made collectively by the society by including as many stakeholders as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of privacy, more specifically, protecting the privacy of subjects of clinical trials concerns me the most, given my background in privacy research with biomedical data. Although data from clinical trials must be made available for research, we must be extremely careful and sensitive towards the privacy of the participants. Legal frameworks such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html&quot;&gt;HIPAA&lt;/a&gt; have fostered a positive change, but groundbreaking technologies such as cryptography and blockchain have a huge role to play in building transparency and trust for data sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue that received worldwide attention was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-seeds-of-suicide-how-monsanto-destroys-farming/5329947&quot;&gt;plight of the farmers using Monsanto seeds&lt;/a&gt;, and over here rises the ethical issue of what can be patented and what must not be. At the same time, we need to make sure that the world remains free and clear of bioterrorism, which can prove to be very potent and can lead to a huge loss of human lives. In this regard, we must come together and discuss the relevant points such that our research does not take the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, I believe that biotechnology and healthcare always have a human element to them, and research in these fields are undertaken to benefit humanity as a whole. Therefore, healthcare must always be affordable, and biotechnology, as a field, must be unselfish. Although, in future, biotechnological progress might involve processes such as germ-line manipulation, we must be extremely careful before we tread this path. In this case, future generations automatically become important stakeholders, and therefore, the ethical questions posed must be answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great time to be enthusiastic about biotechnological progress, and the wider societal impact they will have. At the same time, I believe that discussions concerning ethics should never be done behind closed doors. In this regard, I am hopeful that suitable public platforms for discussion and negotiation will go a long way in ensuring that we always take the right step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Human Aspects of Privacy in Relation to Personalization</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/01/20/human-privacy/"/>
   <updated>2018-01-20T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2018/01/20/human-privacy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The concept of privacy is inherently intertwined with human attitudes and behaviours, as most computer systems are primarily designed for human-use. Especially in the case of Recommender Systems, which feed on information provided by individuals, their efficacy critically depends on whether or not information is externalized, and if it is, how much of this information contributes positively to their performance and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my seminar on &lt;strong&gt;Privacy and Big Data&lt;/strong&gt; taken at RWTH, I discussed the impact of several factors on users’ information disclosure behaviours and privacy-related attitudes, and how users of recommender systems can be nudged into making better privacy decisions for themselves. Apart from that, I also addressed the problem of privacy adaptation, i.e. effectively tailoring Recommender Systems by gaining a deeper understanding of people’s cognitive decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seminar was taken under Prof. Dr. Stefan Decker at the chair of Databases and Information Systems. The full seminar report can be found &lt;a href=&quot;../documents/human-privacy.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

   <title>IDEA League Summer School on Responsible Robotics and AI</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/11/07/summer-school/"/>
   <updated>2017-11-07T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2017/11/07/summer-school</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 27–30th August, 2017, a summer school on “Responsible Robotics and AI” was hosted at the Technische Universiteit Delft.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://idealeague.org/summerschool/&quot;&gt;IDEA League Summer School&lt;/a&gt; is a collaborative summer programme for graduate students and PhDs of the respective member universities. The diverse group of participants included those from ETH Zürich, RWTH Aachen, Chalmers University of Technology, RWTH Aachen, Politecnico di Milano and TokyoTech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../pictures/idealeague.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Singing at DIG Event&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-was-this-summer-school-about-and-why-is-it-important&quot;&gt;What was this summer school about, and why is it important?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic, i.e &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible Robotics and AI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is truly an inter-disciplinary amalgamation of topics such as psychology, robotics, ethics, design and computer science. As robots become more omnipresent and a significantly larger part of our personal lives, several ethical questions confront us as humans. The summer school tried to discuss and address these questions by stimulating the students not only with the latest academic research, but also with dialogues, conversations and productive group-activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-were-the-participants&quot;&gt;Who were the participants?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were about 20 participants from IDEA League and ASPIRE League universities. Even more striking was the fact that the participants came from diverse and heterogeneous cultural backgrounds. There were participants from Italy, India, China, Vietnam, Portugal and Colombia to name a few. This ensured that the discussions always had different perspectives and it was extremely stimulating to think about various issues such as humanitarian aid, sex robots, robot laws from various points of view and appreciate the different factors involved in different situations. At the same time, there were friendly and informal discussions about different countries and their cultures, adding a whole new gamut of inter-cultural learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-were-the-talks-about&quot;&gt;What were the talks about?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the topic is highly inter-disciplinary, the talks were also designed to give us different perspectives of the topic. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tpm/about-the-faculty/departments/values-technology-and-innovation/people/assistant-professors/dr-a-aimee-van-wynsberghe/&quot;&gt;Aimee Van Wynsberghe&lt;/a&gt; from TU Delft introduced the topic and provided an essential treatment of ethics and embedded it into the subject of robotics. &lt;a href=&quot;http://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/johanna-seibt(60a3d664-19f6-4fb6-9bde-625e6cee6f53).html&quot;&gt;Johanna Seibt&lt;/a&gt; from Aarhus University talked about how to attribute responsibility in robotics. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.denisesoesilo.com/&quot;&gt;Denise Soesilo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tpm/about-the-faculty/departments/multi-actor-systems/people/associate-professors/dr-tc-tina-comes/&quot;&gt;Tina Comes&lt;/a&gt; talked about the use of robots in humanitarian aid. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tudelft.nl/en/3me/organisation/organisation/departments/process-energy/people/intensified-reaction-separation-systems/barry-fitzgerald/&quot;&gt;Barry Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; talked about taking inspiration from superhero movies to develop more advanced robotic technologies. &lt;a href=&quot;http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/N.Sharkey/&quot;&gt;Noel Sharkey&lt;/a&gt; addressed the controversial issue of sex-robots, and the ethical issues involved with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;was-it-all-work-and-no-play&quot;&gt;Was it all work and no play?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not at all. The summer school featured talks and group activities from morning until 5 pm. But after that, the participants had time every day to interact among themselves and explore the wonderful city of Delft and The Hague. We made the best use of this time and got a taste of Dutch culture. The beautiful markets of Delft and street concerts on the weekend were very exciting. At the same time, we also had a chance to try the famous ‘Fries and Mayonnaise’, dutch cheese and other varieties of food. On one of the evenings, the organisers hosted a social dinner in which all the participants and speakers participated. This gave us an opportunity to have informal discussions not only among ourselves, but also with the speakers. The food was delicious as well. On the final day of the summer school, we had student presentations on innovative subjects within the realm of robot ethics. The presentations were uniquely creative, and was well-appreciated by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Feature Extraction And Statistical Analysis Of Ragas In Indian Classical Music - A Summary</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/05/01/computer-music/"/>
   <updated>2017-05-01T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2017/05/01/computer-music</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hindustani Classical Music is a music form originating from the northern part of India. It was composed between 1500-900 B.C, making it widely regarded as one of the oldest music systems in the world. Traditionally, it has been enjoyed as not just a means for aesthetic pleasure, but a way of realizing inner happiness and self-release. There is also a strong sense of spirituality associated with Hindustani Music, which is essential for its study and practice. The most striking feature of Hindustani Music is its imaginative and improvised nature, which implies that there are no written script even while performing. There are no fixed compositions that the artist has to adhere to. In effect, the entire performance is an extempore, and the artist is playing the role of the singer, composer and the conductor all at the same time. The artist adheres to a concept called as the Raga. The Raga is the central melodic concept in Indian music. According to Rao et al., it is neither a tune, nor is it a modal scale, but rather a continuum with scale and tune as its extremes. Broadly speaking, it can be termed as a melodic mode or tonal matrix possessing a rigid and specific individual identity, yet bearing immense potential for infinite improvisatory possibilities. The raga serves as a basic grammar for composition and improvisation in Indian music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of statistical and probabilistic tools in Musicology is not new. Temperley and Beran have very systematically laid down the probabilistic and statistical techniques used for music analyses respectively. The well-defined structure of a Raga makes the possibility of the usage of probabilistic and stochastic modeling techniques extremely favourable. Although the notes and intonations in an artist’s rendition are inherently unpredictable, there are some properties of the raga, e.g. the most dominant note (vadi), the second most dominant note (samvadi) and the identifying tonic pattern(pakad), which are more-or-less kept constant. This has led to the development of several approaches for automatic classification and clustering of ragas. The task of raga identification has been a subject of great curiosity among researchers. Given the fact that music is an art, and the plethora of improvisation possibilities that the artist can employ, even seasoned human listeners sometimes find it difficult to identify ragas. Indeed, some ragas have very minute differences, some have the same scale and notes, however the pattern of their usage and the corresponding emotions induced can be extremely different. One of the most notable examples is Raga Bhupali and Raga Deshkar. Some sophisticated automatic techniques have, however been fairly successful as they are able to infer a whole body of information about the raga using techniques such as Pitch Distribution Methods, Transposition Invariance Uniform Time Scaling and Vector Space Modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research and experiments over the course of the seminar on Computer Music, taken during my Master degree at RWTH, attempted to inquire into the different approaches used for feature extraction and statistical analysis of ragas, and how these are further employed for Tonic Similarity Calculation, Raga Identification, Mood Detection, Detection and Classification of Melodic Motifs and Automatic Music Composition. The full presentation can be accessed over &lt;a href=&quot;../documents/raga.pdf&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Responsible and Ethical Robotics</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/04/30/responsible-robotics/"/>
   <updated>2017-04-30T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2017/04/30/responsible-robotics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever since the inception of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics as a discipline, the aim of researchers has been to make machines as intelligent as possible. In other words, to make machines function as if they had their own mind. Although this presents an exciting prospect for humanity, I believe that we would have to collectively shoulder the moral and ethical responsibilities associated with these efforts. In my opinion, creating machines with minds would be tantamount to giving birth to a whole new species, which we might or might not have full control over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exciting (and sometimes haunting) prospect makes Robotics and AI much more than a standalone discipline. It requires a culmination of thoughts, concepts and processes from several other sciences and arts, such as Psychology, Anthropology, Ethics, Law, Production Engineering and several others. This means that future robotics doesn’t just have to ensure good design and high productivity, but it also needs to take into account all the other humane and ethical factors. Some intriguing questions that immediately come to mind are: Should Robots have rights? Should there be a maximum time limit for which they can be put to work? For a sustainable and harmonious future, we would need answers to such questions, and this would require knowledge about not just artificial intelligence, but how it intimately interacts with the other scientific fields mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>From the Old Archives - The Pursuit of Optimization</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2014/12/10/the-pursuit-of-optimization/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-10T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2014/12/10/the-pursuit-of-optimization</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Plain and simple, optimization is essentially the art, science and mathematics of choosing the best among a given set of finite or infinite alternatives. It gets as close to real life as it can. Optimization Problems are one of the most important as well as critical problems faced by man, given the basic principle of Economics that our wants are endless, and resources, finite. It’s an inter-disciplinary subject, cutting across Economics, Mathematics, Engineering and Natural Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Roman Legend, the earliest possible mention of an optimization problem was in 500 BCE in the tale of Princess Dido. She was fleeing from the prosecution of her brother and a piece of land on the Mediterranean coast caught her fancy. She made a deal with the local leader. She requested him to cut a bull’s hide into thin strips and tie them up and enclose as much land as one can with it. In modern day language the problem is mathematically stated as follows - &lt;em&gt;Among all closed curves of a given length find the one that encloses maximum area&lt;/em&gt;. This is called the &lt;em&gt;Isoperimetric problem&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great minds like Lagrange, Gauss, Newton, Bernoulli and Euler have all had significant contributions to the Optimization Theory, but a significant impetus was provided to it with the development of Linear Programming as an Optimization Technique. A linear programming problem consists of linear functions as objective and constraints. It became apparent that linear programming has tremendous applications in economics, military operations, business, engineering, etc. It was the development of the simplex method for solving linear programming problems that became the turning point of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the field of Computer Sciences, Algorithmics deals with the problems of optimization and how to devise the most optimal solution. There are several algorithms which have been developed over the years to tackle problems of the kind. Russian Novelist Ivan Turgenev said - &lt;em&gt;Whatever man prays for, he prays for a miracle. Every prayer reduces itself to this—Great God, grant that twice two be not four.&lt;/em&gt; This would make absolute sense to a computer scientist, who knows that if optimization problems are tried to be solved using the Brute-Force or Divide-and-Conquer mechanism, it would lead to exponential complexity, which is computationally the most tedious calculation possible. Even for an input size as small as 40, and with ample processing power, the solution may take several minutes, or probably hours to compute.
In the above situation, Richard Bellman came with an alternative in the 1950s, which we now know as &lt;em&gt;‘Dynamic Programming’&lt;/em&gt;. On analysis, it is not tough to show that Dynamic Programming yields the solution of several optimization problems in Polynomial Time, which is a massive leap from the exponential time complexity given by its Brute-Force counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic Programming believes that optimal solutions to a problem incorporate optimal solutions to its related sub-problems, which may be solved independently. It works as follows: having observed that a naïve recursive solution is inefficient because it solves the same sub problems repeatedly, we arrange for each sub-problem to be solved only once, saving its solution. If we need to refer to this sub-problem’s solution again later, we can just look it up, rather than recompute it. Dynamic Programming thus uses additional memory to save computation time.
Because of its efficiency and ease of solving computationally demanding optimization problems, Dynamic Programming has retained itself as a Programmer’s Choice, and search engines like Google, social networks like Facebook and Twitter all have numerous usages of Dynamic Programming at each stage of their coding process.&lt;/p&gt;
