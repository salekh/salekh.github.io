title: Life Update - February 2021
---

Unfortunately, I have spent way too much time away from my webpage, as a result there isn't a lot of new content here. I hope I'll be able to change it this year. 

This past year has truly upended the lives of one and all. My thoughts are with each and every soul on this planet, who has lost one of his/her loved ones to this virus, for whom the light at the end of the tunnel is the faintest of all. May the lord give you strength.
