title: Life Update - February 2021
---

Unfortunately, I have spent way too much time not writing anything for my webpage. I hope I'll be able to change it this year. The past year has truly upended the lives of one and all. My thoughts are with each and every soul on this planet, who have lost one of their loved ones to this virus, for whom the light at the end of the tunnel is the faintest of all. May God provide you strength.
