title: About Me
---
Welcome to my personal webpage. I am <strong>Sanchit Alekh</strong>. Apart from being a student of Computer Science, I am really passionate about music (Art in general, but music stands out), photography, cooking and traveling. I currently live and study in Aachen, located at the westernmost point of Germany. It is one of the few cities in the world which is located at the crossroads of 3 countries.

I study at the [RWTH Aachen University](http://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/?lidx=1), Germany's largest and leading technical university. The [Computer Science](http://www.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/) Department is situated at the nice and picturesque [Informatikzentrum](https://goo.gl/maps/H8KGQxtRfG52).

To know more about my personal life, please visit [this](http://salekh.github.io/personal_life/) page. To know about my academics, head to my [Academics]() page.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:
