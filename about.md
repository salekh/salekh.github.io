title: About Me
---
Welcome to my personal webpage. I am <strong>Sanchit Alekh</strong>. 

I am currently working as a Big Data Engineer at [Data Reply GmbH](https://www.reply.com/data-reply/en/) in Munich, where I work on a diverse range of projects, mainly in the area of cloud and distributed computing. On my most recent project, I worked as a part of a team that developed an enterprise chatbot platform on the Microsoft Azure Cloud using technologies such as Kubernetes, Terraform, Botframework and Microsoft Cognitive Services.

Combining my knowledge of software engineering, databases and distributed systems, I help customers develop and deploy complex software that routinely interacts with, and acts upon massive amounts of data on different kinds of infrastructure, i.e., on-premise or on public clouds such as AWS, Azure or GCP.

Previously, I was working as a Data Scientist Intern at [AUDI AG](https://www.audi.com/de.html) in Neckarsulm, Germany, where our focus was on building solutions for smart-factories and enable data-driven production. I am a firm champion of using data analytics for making production more efficient, cost-effective and less wasteful.

I pursued my MSc. in Software Systems Engineering from [RWTH Aachen University](http://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/?lidx=1), Germany's largest and leading technical university, where my coursework and research were focused in the area of 'Data and Information Management'. I was closely associated with the chair of Databases and Information Systems, where I worked under Prof. Christoph Quix.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
