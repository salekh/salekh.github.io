I am extremely honored and ecstatic to be associated with a subject that has made significant inroads and contributions to the human life in the past 30 years. I believe that the rise of computers and computer-based services are akin to the Industrial Revolution in their own right.

I am learning new things about the subject every day, but these are the topics (in no particular order) I care most about, and follow very closely.
