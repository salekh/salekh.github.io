# Sanchit's Personal Webpage

This is the code repository for [Sanchit Alekh](http://sanchitalekh.in)'s webpage. It is based on [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde), a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. Hyde itself, is based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
