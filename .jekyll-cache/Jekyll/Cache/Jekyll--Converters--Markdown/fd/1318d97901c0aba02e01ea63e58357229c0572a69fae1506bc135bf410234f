I"Ä<p>Unfortunately, I have spent way too much time away from my webpage, as a result there isnâ€™t a lot of new content here. I hope Iâ€™ll be able to change it this year.</p>

<p>This past year has truly upended the lives of one and all. My thoughts are with each and every soul on this planet, who has lost one of his/her loved ones to this virus, for whom the light at the end of the tunnel is the faintest of all. May the lord give you strength.</p>
